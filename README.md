# MEAN stack CRUD

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.9. This project was based off https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mean-apps-restful-api#complete-the-project-and-deploy.

## About
This project is a mini project for me to learn to build a MEAN stack application with REST API. This project was staged onto Heroku.

MEAN refers to MonogoDB, ExpressJS, Angular and NodeJS while REST (REpresentational State Transfer) where the APIs allow the software programs to communicate. 

## How to start
1. `npm install -g @angular/cli`
2. Start your own Angular Application by `ng new name-of-project-here`
3. Go into your directory by `cd name-of-project-here`
4. Launch by `ng serve -o` for dev server. It will open up `http://localhost:4200/` automatically and reload on its own everytime you made a change

You can go ahead and make your angular application. 

## Deployment
You can either deploy through Github or through Heroku CLI. 
### Using Heroku CLI
* Heroku CLI, please download [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
